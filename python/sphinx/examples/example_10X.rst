scRNA-seq data - 10X chromium HDF5(h5) file
========

We show an exmaple for scRNA-seq data produced by 10X Chromium. 
We use a sample of `500 Human PBMCs, 3' LT v3.1, Chromium Controller` in `10X Genomics Datasets <https://www.10xgenomics.com/jp/resources/datasets>`_.  
The test data is directly avairable from `Feature / cell matrix HDF5 (filtered)` in <https://www.10xgenomics.com/jp/resources/datasets/500-human-pbm-cs-3-lt-v-3-1-chromium-controller-3-1-low-6-1-0> (need register).
