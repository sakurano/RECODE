scRNA-seq data - 10X chromium HDF5(h5) file
========

We show an exmaple for scRNA-seq data p@roduced by 10X Chromium. 
We use test data `500_PBMC_3p_LT_Chromium_Controller_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5` of experiment `500 Human PBMCs, 3' LT v3.1, Chromium Controller`. 
The test data is avairable from `10X Genomics Datasets<https://www.10xgenomics.com/jp/resources/datasets/500-human-pbm-cs-3-lt-v-3-1-chromium-controller-3-1-low-6-1-0>`_ (``Feature / cell matrix HDF5 (filtered)``).
